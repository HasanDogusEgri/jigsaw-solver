# jigsaw-solver
Jigsaw puzzle solver algorithm prepared for MECE 445 lecture.
This repo solves jigsaw puzzles dynamically. 
Only hands on part is arranging the puzzle parts such that they do not intersect with each other as well as they have enough space between each other.
The parts must be large enough to run the algorithm successfully.
The code works only for a specific type of parts. The parts were collected from https://www.jigsawplanet.com/
