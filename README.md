# Jigsaw puzzle solver algorithm
* This repo solves jigsaw puzzles dynamically. 
* Only hands on part is arranging the puzzle parts such that they do not intersect and have enough space between each other.
* The parts must be large enough to run the algorithm successfully.
* The code works only for a specific type of parts. The parts were collected from https://www.jigsawplanet.com/ 
* For more information, please contact.
